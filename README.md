## Problem Statement
This case study focuses on solving real business problems using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It aims to develop a foundational understanding of risk analytics in the banking and financial services sector, specifically how data can minimize the risk of loss when lending to customers.

## Business Objectives
The goal is to find patterns in applicant and loan data that indicate the likelihood of default. This knowledge helps the company:
- Deny loans to high-risk applicants
- Reduce loan amounts
- Charge higher interest rates for risky loans

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, various EDA techniques will be applied to:

- Analyze consumer and loan attributes.
- Identify patterns and correlations that indicate potential defaults.
- Provide insights that can guide the company's lending strategies.

## Conclusion
#### Loan Default Driving Factors
- Debt-To-Income (DTI) Ratio is directly proportional
- Loan Grades and sub-grades is directly proportional
- Loan Terms (Tenure) of 60 months is riskier than 30 months.
- Loan Purpose, specifically small business seems to be risky.
- Interest Rate group is also directly proportional
#### Loan Default Non Driving Factors
- Home Ownership
- Address State
- Income Verification Status
- Employment Length
